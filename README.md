#Restaurants

You find yourself wondering how your family can have such difficulty arranging a night out. Every Friday night, your family goes out to eat. The discussion of where to eat, unfortunately, is often drawn out and sometimes becomes a little heated. Thinking about the NCAA Tournament, you get a brilliant idea of how to more efficiently make a selection.

Instead of fighting over several restaurants at once, you can use this program; it eliminates one restaurant at a time by pitting two restaurants against each other until a single restaurant remains. Your family can now decide where to eat based on answering a series of yes/no questions. While this doesn't eliminate all of the arguing, it does simplify the decisions to be made.
